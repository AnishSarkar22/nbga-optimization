## Differences Between `tsp_enhanced.py` and `tsp.py`

This section outlines the key differences and improvements introduced in `tsp_enhanced.py` compared to the original `tsp.py` implementation for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using genetic and metaheuristic algorithms.

### 1. Algorithm Enhancements

- **Advanced Initialization**:
  - `tsp_enhanced.py` uses the nearest neighbor heuristic for initializing a portion of the population, leading to better starting solutions. In contrast, `tsp.py` initializes the population entirely at random.

- **Adaptive Parameters**:
  - Population size, mutation rates, and elite selection are adaptively set in `tsp_enhanced.py` based on problem size and progress, whereas `tsp.py` uses fixed values.

- **Diverse Elite Selection**:
  - Enhanced version selects elite solutions with diversity consideration (using Hamming distance), while the original uses simple top-N selection.

### 2. Genetic Operators

- **Crossover Operators**:
  - `tsp_enhanced.py` implements multi-point neighbourhood crossover and enhanced logic for filling child tours, improving solution quality.
  - The original uses single-segment neighbourhood crossover and simpler filling strategies.

- **Mutation Operators**:
  - The enhanced version applies multiple mutation operators (2-opt, 3-opt, Or-opt, Lin-Kernighan, swap, and local search) with adaptive probabilities.
  - The original only uses swap mutation and basic neighbourhood mutation.

### 3. Local Search and Metaheuristics

- **Intensive Local Search**:
  - `tsp_enhanced.py` integrates intensive local search (2-opt, 3-opt, Or-opt, Lin-Kernighan) within mutation and as post-processing, leading to better exploitation of local minima.
  - `tsp.py` uses only basic 2-opt and swap moves.

- **Simulated Annealing**:
  - Both versions implement simulated annealing for local improvement, but the enhanced version uses more sophisticated acceptance criteria and operator diversity.

### 4. Algorithm Diversity

- **Algorithm Implementations**:
  - All four algorithms (NBGA, SWAP_GATSP, OX_SIM, MOC_SIM) in `tsp_enhanced.py` are improved with advanced heuristics and metaheuristics.
  - The original implements basic versions of these algorithms.

### 5. Performance Comparison and Visualization

- **Comprehensive Analysis**:
  - `tsp_enhanced.py` includes detailed statistical summaries, performance plots, and analysis of results across datasets.
  - The original provides only basic result reporting and visualization.

### 6. Code Structure and Readability

- **Modular Design**:
  - The enhanced version is more modular, with clear separation of heuristics, operators, and analysis functions.
  - Improved documentation and comments for maintainability.

### 7. Parameterization and Flexibility

- **Flexible Parameters**:
  - `tsp_enhanced.py` allows for easy adjustment of algorithm parameters, operator probabilities, and local search intensity.
  - The original is less flexible and harder to tune for different problem instances.

---

**Summary:**

`tsp_enhanced.py` is a significantly improved and more flexible implementation, offering better solution quality, advanced heuristics, and comprehensive analysis compared to the original `tsp.py`.
